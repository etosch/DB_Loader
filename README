# DB_Loader

To load files into the cloud, use the bash script load_csv_to_cloud.sh in the scripts folder.

A utility for managing log files.
USAGE: lein run -m db_loader :filename ~/log_file_location/some_output_file.log :problemname problem
lein run -m db_loader :clean (some-list-of-csv-files | all)
lein run -m db_loader :filename ~/log_file_location/some_output_file.log :problemname problem :mysql {password P@$$w0rd db-host localhost}

The :problemname argument is optional; it's used to look up and track semantically grouped problems (e.g. all dsoar problems).
Settings are held in the ~/.db_config file. If you do not already have one, one will be created.
